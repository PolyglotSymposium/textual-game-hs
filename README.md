TODO What should we call this game?
===============

A for-fun project to learn Haskell by building a text-based game something like
Hack from the old BSD games (`sudo apt-get install bsdgames`) or Chip's
Challenge.

## What I did to install Haskell

### On Windows

Downloaded Haskell Platform and installed it.

### On Linux

    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
